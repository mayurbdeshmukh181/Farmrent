# FarmRent - Share, Hire, Farm smarter

FarmRent is a web-based prototype designed to help small and marginal farmers rent agricultural machinery and hire labour with transparent pricing and reliable availability. The platform connects farmers, machinery owners and labourers through one unified digital marketplace.

## 1. Overview

Small farmers face difficulties accessing machinery and labour during crucial agricultural periods. FarmRent solves this by enabling:

- Transparent machinery rentals
- Task-based labour hiring
- A farmer-first booking workflow

This README outlines the problem, users, goals, features, and flows that guided the development of the prototype.

## 2. Problem Statement

Indian smallholder farmers struggle with:

1. High dependency on unregulated offline machinery rental channels  
2. Unavailability of labour during peak seasons  
3. No transparency in pricing or booking confirmations  
4. Inefficient manual processes involving phone calls or intermediaries  

**Impact:** Delayed farming operations, reduced yields and higher operational costs.

FarmRent aims to standardize access to machinery and labour through a simple digital platform.
